We repeat, driver alertness is necessary, but not sufficient, for openpilot to be used safely and openpilot is provided with no warranty of fitness for any purpose.</p> <p>openpilot is developed in good faith to be compliant with FMVSS requirements and to follow industry standards of safety for Level 2 Driver Assistance Systems. In particular, we observe ISO26262 guidelines, including those from pertinent documents released by NHTSA. In addition, we impose strict coding guidelines (like MISRA C : 2012) on parts of openpilot that are safety relevant. We also perform software-in-the-loop, hardware-in-the-loop and in-vehicle tests before each software release.</p> <p>Following Hazard and Risk Analysis and FMEA, at a very high level, we have designed openpilot ensuring two main safety requirements.</p> <ol> <li>The driver must always be capable to immediately retake manual control of the vehicle,    by stepping on the brake pedal or by pressing the cancel button.</li> <li>The vehicle must not alter its trajectory too quickly for the driver to safely    react.
